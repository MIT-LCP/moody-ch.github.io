# Frequently Asked Questions

<a name="test-data"></a> __Can you share the test data for the current Challenge or a previous Challenge?__

No, we do not share the test data for the Challenges.

By keeping the test data and labels private, we retain the ability to score algorithms and use the test data as part of future Challenges.

We are aware that some other public competitions release their test data (either with or without labels), but this limits the meaningfulness of any results on the test data. If you feel strongly that test data should be released, then we strongly encourage you to participate in these other competitions.

Moreover, we try to source diverse datasets for the Challenges, and we often use datasets in the Challenges that we are unable release as test data.

<a name="scoring"></a> __Can you score my algorithm for one of the previous Challenges?__

Yes, we are happy to support ongoing research with past Challenges subject to available resources (the Challenges are largely run by volunteers) and whether you are able to do the following:

1. You must share your code in a GitHub or Gitlab repository.
2. You must include your code, including your training code and forward model.
3. You must include an open-source LICENSE file, an AUTHORS file, and a README file that describes the results on the training set.
4. You must include a detailed draft article describing your method, including the results on the training set (matching the results in your README), with the target journal for your submission.
5. Your article must describe how your technique differs from all other methods from the Challenge and the subsequent focus issue, especially any previous methods that you may have developed.
6. You must include a statement that no one from your team will attempt to submit another entry. Each team receives at most one follow-up shot at the data.
7. We must be able to run your code. For recent Challenges, we expect you to follow the submission instructions and format your submission in the same way.

If you agree to the above conditions, then please contact us at challenge@physionet.org to submit your entry. Even so, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to run your code.
