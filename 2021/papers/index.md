The above CinC paper is a draft. We will update it after CinC to include information about the conclusion of the Challenge.

## Templates

Please follow the [preparation and submission instructions](https://www.cinc.org/instructions-for-preparing-and-submitting-full-papers/) for your CinC papers.

We have prepared templates to help you prepare your CinC papers. Please use the LaTeX template ([Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qqsvqvyrqkzr
) or [download](cinc_template.zip)) or the [Word template](cinc_template.docx). These [templates](cinc_template.pdf) include important instructions, advice, and references.

Please *read* these instructions and one of the templates. Each year, we need to provide feedback for many teams that miss some of the paper requirements, and each year, some papers are unfortunately rejected because the teams were unable to address important issues.

## Focus Issue Papers

The [Physiological Measurement Focus Collection: Classification of Multilead ECGs](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/page/Focus%20issues) includes the above [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6579/abc960).

## Conference Papers

The conference papers for [Computing in Cardiology 2021](https://www.cinc2021.org/) will be available on the [CinC](https://www.cinc.org/cinc-papers-on-line/) and [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000157/all-proceedings) websites.
