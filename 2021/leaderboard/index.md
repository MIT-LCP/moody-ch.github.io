# Leaderboards

These are the leaderboards for the official phase of the 2021 Challenge. The scores are the [Challenge scoring metric](../#scoring) on the twelve-lead, six-lead, four-lead, three-lead, and two-lead versions of the [validation data](../#data) (the same recordings but with subsets of the original twelve leads).

Please click on the tabs at the bottom of the leaderboard to see the different tracks of the channel.
